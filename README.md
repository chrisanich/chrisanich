I’m a medical doctor with fourteen years of clinical experience across several fields, now combining my background in medicine with advanced data analytics, computer science, and AI. I hold an MSc in Data Analytics (NFQ Level 9, Ireland) and a Higher Diploma in Computer Science (NFQ Level 8, Ireland). My current work focuses on AI for embedded systems and cloud-native software development.

Beyond technology and medicine, I’m a passionate music producer with over twenty years of studies and experience in music creation, production and internationalisation. You can find some of my work at [youtube.com/@chrisanich4373](https://www.youtube.com/@chrisanich4373).
